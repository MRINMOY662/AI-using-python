Ans : In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.
Question : what is superconductivity 
Ans : Superconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic flux fields occurring in certain materials, called superconductors, when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature.
Question : what is chemistry 
Ans : Chemistry is the study of the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of matter.
Question : what is kinematics 
Ans : Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that studies the motion of bodies without regard to their mass or the forces that cause the motion.
Question : what is m? 
Ans : M is the mass of an object.
Question : what is m 
Ans : M is the mass of an object.
Question : what is universal law of gravitation 
Ans : The universal law of gravitation is a law that states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Question : An engineer is designing the runway for an airport. Of the planes that will use the airport, the lowest acceleration rate is likely to be 3 m/s2. The takeoff speed for this plane will be 65 m/s. Assuming this minimum acceleration, what is the minimum allowed length for the runway? 
Ans : The minimum allowed length for the runway is 704 m.
Question :  
Ans : The question is unclear.
Question : what is nuclear science 
Ans : Nuclear science is the study of the nuclei of atoms and the interactions between them.
Question : write a poem on science and technology 
Ans : Science and technology,
The two great pillars of our society.

Science gives us knowledge,
Technology gives us power.

With science we can understand the world,
With technology we can change it.

Science is the quest for truth,
Technology is the application of that truth.

Science is the light that illuminates the way,
Technology is the hand that builds the future.
Question : can velocity be negative 
Ans : Yes, velocity can be negative. Velocity is a vector quantity, so it has a magnitude and a direction. The direction can be either positive or negative, depending on the reference frame.
Question : what are vectors 
Ans : Vectors are mathematical objects that have both a magnitude and a direction. They can be used to represent physical quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction, such as force, velocity, and displacement.
Question :  
Ans : The question is unclear.
Question : If log 2 = 0.3010 and log 3 = 0.4771, the value of log5 512 is 
Ans : 3.875
Question : If log 2 = 03.301 and log 3 = 0.4771, find the value of log3 725 
Ans : 19.46
Question : If log 2 = 03.301 and log 3 = 0.4771, find the value of log3 725 
Ans : 19.46
Question :  If x, y and z are the sides of a right angled triangle, where �z� is the hypotenuse, then find the value of (1/logx+zy) + (1/logx-zy) 
Ans : 2
Question : okay what is velocity 
Ans : Velocity is a vector quantity that measures the rate of change of position of an object. It has a magnitude (the speed) and a direction.

Question : ok so what is the diameter of moon 
Ans : The diameter of the moon is 3,474 kilometers.
Question : what is jarvis 
Ans : Jarvis is a computer program that can recognize and respond to standard dialogue, such as "How are you?" or "What's your name?"

Question : okay so what is quantum computing 
Ans : Quantum computing is a type of computing where information is processed using quantum bits instead of classical bits. This makes quantum computers much faster and more powerful than traditional computers.
